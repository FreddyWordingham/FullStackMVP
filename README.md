# The Stack

A wide and shallow example of how to build a serverless full-stack application.

- **App**: TypeScript + React
- **Server**: Python + FastAPI
- **Database**: Python + MongoDB
- **Scripting**: Python
- **Library**: Rust
- **GPU**: WebGPU
- **Deployment**: Serverless + Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

The application itself visualises the beautiful Julia set, a fractal that is generated by iterating a complex function.
The user can interact with the fractal by zooming in and out, and changing the colour scheme.

## App

The app is a React application written in TypeScript.

## Server

The server is a FastAPI application written in Python.

## Database

The database is a MongoDB database using the official Python driver.

## Scripting

A Python library is used to script the generation of the fractal.

## Library

A Rust library is used to calculate the fractal.

## GPU

When using a GPU to accelerate the fractal calculations, the WebGPU language is used.

## Deployment

The application is deployed serverlessly using Docker and the serverless framework.

> Note: Serverless instances can not access GPUs.

## CI/CD

The application is continuously integrated and deployed using GitHub Actions.
